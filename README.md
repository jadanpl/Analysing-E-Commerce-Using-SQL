# Analysing-E-Commerce-Using-SQL
For this project, I obtained the dataset from Kaggle. It contains sales data from an Indian E-commerce website spanning from April 2018 to march 2019. Below is the entity-relationship diagram that I created using template on MIRO application. <br><br>

# Hypothetical Questions
1. The marketing department is running a sales campaign and they target the customer with different sales materials. They categorized customers into groups based on the RFM model. Show the number and percentage for each customer segment as the final result. Order the results by the percentage of customers.
2. Find the number of orders, customers, cities, and states.
3. Find the new customers who made purchases in the year 2019. Only shows the top 5 new customers and their respective cities and states. Order the result by the amount they spent.
4. Find the top 10 profitable states & cities so that the company can expand its business. Determine the number of products sold and the number of customers in these top 10 profitable states & cities.
5. Display the details (in terms of “order_date”, “order_id”, “State”, and “CustomerName”) for the first order in each state. Order the result by “order_id”.
6. Determine the number of orders (in the form of a histogram) and sales for different days of the week.
7. Check the monthly profitability and monthly quantity sold to see if there are patterns in the dataset.
8. Determine the number of times that salespeople hit or failed to hit the sales target for each category.
9. Find the total sales, total profit, and total quantity sold for each category and sub-category. Return the maximum cost and maximum price for each sub-category too.
